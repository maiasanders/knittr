# Knittr

A web based app that allows users to write, record and share knitting patterns, as well as keep track of their current projects.

## Getting started
It's as simple as creating an account through our register page!

## Creating patterns
To start go to "My Projects & Patterns" (the open book icon if you are on mobile) on the nav bar. Select the "My Patterns" option from the tabs or dropdown (on mobile) at the top. Once there click the "Create new Pattern" button to get started.

### New pattern
Once you are at the form, simply enter the name of your pattern, a description, and select some categories. Then click the "Create Pattern" button to continue.

### Your first pattern version
Select the weight of yarn and size from the drop-down menus, and hit "Start knitting" to begin writing your first pattern. Additional size and yarn combos can be added later from the "My Patterns" page.

#### Additional versions
Whether you have completely written your first version or not, you can add additional sizes and/or yarn weight versions add any time from the "My Patterns" page. Simply click the "+ Add variant" button to start a new one.

## Writing your pattern
Click the "+ Step" button to add your first step. You will enter a title, and what rows/rounds make up that step. If you want to add more rows to the current (existing), simply click the "Row +" button. For sections of your pattern with regular repeats like lacework or fairisle, you can adjust the repeats and your pattern will automatically be updated with the appropriate number when you hit save. Repeat until your pattern is complete. The other features that are available for projects are also here (see "Projects" section for more info)

## Using existing patterns
Existing patterns written by yourself or other users can be used to start new projects

### Finding patterns
Navigate to the "Discover Patterns" page (magnifying glass icon on small screens) to view existing patterns to find your next project. Click on a pattern to view more details about it.

### Pattern details
After clicking a pattern you will be directed to more information about it. Here you can see the author, what categories it is part of, a list of what yarns and sizes it has versions for, as well as a description. Click on the thumbnails of pictures of the completed project to see them full-size. If you wish to save a pattern for later, click on the star icon on the top of the page. If the star is solid, you have already saved it. If you wish to unsave simply click the star again. If you want to start a project with the pattern, click the "Make it!" button to get started.

### Starting a project
Click the "Make it!" button on the pattern details page, a dialog will open with drop downs to select which version of the project you wish to start. First select a size from the first menu. This will automatically give the yarn options for that size in the second menu. When you've made your selections, hit "Start!" to begin. You will be redirected to your new project page.

### Working a project
On the project page you can view the rows of a step by clicking on and expanding that step. When you navigate to an in progress project, the current steps you are on will be open by default. A pin icon will be displayed on your current row.

Make any notes for yourself - like alterations to the project or notes about yarns - by clicking the "+" button in the notes section. On small screens open the notes section by clicking the "Notes" button toward the bottom of the screen, then hide notes when done by click the crossed out eye on the upper right of the pop-up.

There is an integrated stitch counter in the lower right of the screen. The left-most number shows your current total rows completed. You can change the amount of rows you want to add per click by adjusting the number on the right. Click the "+" button ass you complete rows.

#### Finishing a project
Once you have reached the final row, a "Project completed" button will appear. When you click this a dialog will open with an option to upload any pictures of the completed project if you want. Click the upload images button, and select the image you you want to upload, or select camera to take a new one. Hit done to accept the image. You can add a brief description under the image. Click the upload button again to add more.

Once you have added all the desired images, hit "Save Pictures" to finish the uplaod process. Once you have saved your pictures if you are adding them, or right away if you are not adding pictures, click "Back to my projects" to close your project.

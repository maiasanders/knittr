# Knittr

A web based app that allows users to write, record and share knitting patterns, as well as keep track of their current projects.

## Getting started
It's as simple as creating an account through our register page!

## Creating patterns
To start go to "My Projects & Patterns" (the open book icon if you are on mobile) on the nav bar. Select the "My Patterns" option from the tabs or dropdown (on mobile) at the top. Once there click the "Create new Pattern" button to get started.

### New pattern
Once you are at the form, simply enter the name of your pattern, a description, and select some categories. Then click the "Create Pattern" button to continue.

### Your first pattern version
Select the weight of yarn and size from the drop-down menus, and hit "Start knitting" to begin writing your first pattern. Additional size and yarn combos can be added later from the "My Patterns" page.

## Writing you pattern
Click the "+ Step" button to add your first step. You will enter a title, and what rows/rounds make up that step. I you want to add more rows, simply clikc the "Row +" button. For sections of your pattern with regular repeats like lacework or fairisle, you can adjust the repeats and your pattern will automatically be updated with the appropriate number when you hit save.
